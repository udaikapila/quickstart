      <p>It’s 10:30pm and I’m too tired to write all that happened today… it felt like 5 days in one… so in point form a reminder of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>frustrating leaky tube all day, stopped to pump five or six times before it became too much… v frustrating flat tire to change… knew it befor I started and it was as expected… bled everywhere</li>
<li>Ride with the wind was so grateful… so many climbs I wouldn’t have made it without the wind</li>
<li>Albergue, I’m the only one here, it’s a bit awkward to be the only one here but so it is</li>
<li>Riding by the ocean today… as imagined… love it</li>
<li>Little off-road today, was a good balance between road and dirt</li>
<li>Asked someone to take my picture, something I couldn’t do yesterday… growth…</li>
<li>Accidentally spent $100 downloading music… atleast I have music for the rest of the trip now…</li>
<li>Cold and windy, it is going to rain tomorrow</li>
<li>Big dinner, was nice… played with dog, was nice…</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes from 2 years later: I wish I had written more about this places. The Albergue is a converted house (as most of them are), with the attic stacked with bunk beds. There is a couple that lives here, they had a lot of fun making fun of me. They also have a girl who stays with them and helps run the place. Her name is Flo&hellip; she is from France, and she is very nice, in a playful way, in a way that suggest that she is searching for a life irregular, maybe not irregular, maybe unconventional. She has a dog named Patch. Patch ran off from the house so we went to find him at the neighbour&rsquo;s. Flo and I and Patch went for a walk in the evening. The weather was terrible, windy and cold and I’ve never seen a dog poo so much in my life haha… Flo wanted to show me a hidden spot on the ridge that she liked to come to, to be more alone than she was already in this town. What are you hiding from Flo!</em></p>

      <p>I Was keen to get on the road this morning, and the ride out of town was awesome! The day started with quiet country roads, there was a trail through a walking park for like 3 kms, then more country roads, one lane wide… a little bit of climbing, and then the first sight of the Ocean!</p>
<p>I could smell it before I could see it, and the temperature dipped, and even though it wasn’t a milestone at the beginning of the trip, I was really looking forward to seeing a coast and water… it felt great… I took the more difficult hiking trail to stay closer to the coast for a while, before I met some hikers that said I should get on the road for the next bit… lucky that they did because I bumped into a couple of people waiting outside an Albergue, I was tired and I stopped to chat with them and decided to stay here for the night, 15 euros and some people to hang about with… another Canadian amongst them as well!</p>

      <p>Almost forgot to write today… well because I’m still here at my warm showers hosts house in Lugones… It&rsquo;s my first day off on the trip and it feels very strange… I remember this feeling from my other bike trip of being angsty about not moving forward… jolted to a stop, feeling pent up energy and not having anything to do in the day. Getting on the bike and riding is an easy choice… once you’re on, it’s a thing that you are doing and that occupies you, physically, mentally and you don’t have time to worry about anything else. I’ve mentioned this before about just sitting with myself on the bike, I guess that there’s practice to be done to be just sitting with myself off the bike as well…</p>

      <p>Was happy to wake up knowing that today was the descent out of the pass, I had till 6pm to get to my destination about 65kms away so I was ambling about in the morning, had 2 coffees, oats and peanut butter blah blah… chit chat with the other hikers getting ready to depart… then on the road!</p>
<p>The descent was pretty awesome, but also a bit scary! I covered the first ten kilometres in about seventeen minutes… made my first stop just under an hour after starting, at a fancy grocery store where I got a hot sandwich and a cold coffee… weather was great again today… it’s back to being pretty hot now, should’ve realized that mountains have a pretty strong influence on weather conditions… or maybe it’s just a hot day…. Anyway it suits me and hope for it to continue to be hot so that I can camp for the next week on the coastline</p>

      <p>Last night was great, the couple that runs the Albergue made soup and pasta for me and another hiker… dinner was a family affair and even though there was much chatter in Spanish, I was able to paricipate in bits and pieces and it we all survived… the same really uneasy feeling I had going through Portugal is totally non existent here… I got stopped by the cops today for not wearing my helmet and having headphones in… I “Si, si, si…” my way through the entire conversation and even was able to answer where I was going and where I came from… and it was yet another interaction that left me with with another spoonful of hopefulness…</p>

<p>It’s 9:25pm and I just got off my bike about 15 minutes ago… I had planned to stop riding about 20kms ago, but the Albergue that I had on my map was in a deserted little town… I tried to figure it out but there was absolutely nobody around in this whole place… the local bar was no help either as they had no idea who run the Albergue or where they were… that was at about 5pm. I had just climbed the longest climb of the trip so far and drenched in sweat, I decided to keep biking to the next place… stopped at a tourist lodge type thing on the main road and the guy didn’t let me in, said it was closed and directed me to the next town where he said there was another Albergue… another ghost town… a few people, nobody was any help… at least the road was more downhill now than it had been all day….</p>

<p>Today was another good day on the bike, did my first 100kms as the roads were nice and got some climbing in as well as looooong downhills on smooth open road… stopped in Caceres for my pilgrim stamp and then again in a place called Canaveral for lunch… I had spaghetti that was cooked in what I can only guess was ketchup… served me right for picking the most basic thing on the menu… anyway it was cheap and a well timed stop… I stopped again about an hour after that at a gas station and inhaled 2 ice creams and a can of the Spanish Pocari Sweat… </p>

      <p>Today was the easiest day by far on the bike… I had the wind with me and a paved road the whole way, oh and it was at a slight decline as well… I guess when you get, you get….</p>
<p>Started out the day having breakfast with Sabine from Germany at the hostel… she gave me a ton of suggestions for places to go in the north… it was a lot but I think it helped a little… we said our goodbyes as she rode south and I went north… </p>

      <p>Flashback to the end of yesterday…. It’s about 4pm, I’m cycling towards the end of stage 2 which is a town called Santa Olalla… I cycle through a place called Cala about 10kms away and thought I’d check out a place to stay, well it was on the map anyway… I went there and nobody around, the neighbours were having a smoke outside and once engaged with me were throttled into action… the guy started calling all the people he knew that ran hotels or hostels in the area… the cheapest one was 100 euros… while he did that, I also tried to help the cause and checked out bookings.com on my phone… not much, but there was a hostel in a town north of Santa Olalla, about 25kms, and it was 36 euros… I had a solid 3 hours of sunlight and was feeling good so decided to go for it!</p>

      <p>Today was a good day on the bike, headed out lazily from Guillermo’s place and had a companion puppy dog with me for the first 3kms… until I got a bit concerned that she was not turning around… then I walked her back a bit and she seemed to know what was going on and went back the way we came…</p>
<p>The morning started out with a bit of hike a bike on an actual hiking trail that really you couldn’t ride on, but I was feeling strong and relaxed and just took it… it didn’t last as long as the torture last week and the rest of the morning was a downhill cruise on a beautiful dust track…</p>

<p>Wanted to get to Galaroza today so took the highway for the last twenty kms, and it was fairly busy which wasn’t fun to deal with and the twenty six kms took me nearly two and a half hours because it was very uphill for most of it… but then I did get about three kms of downhill fun as well!</p>

      <p>All in all yesterday was a shit day… today in contrast, was great! Only did fifty odd kms but still managed to climb 900m… didn’t feel totally destroyed as it was a more gradual grade on better roads… I think I pushed my bike once today! Crossed the border in the middle of nowhere over a stream on a stone bridge about 2 feet high.. Rui, my host from yesterday said that this used to be an old illegal border crossing but now not so illegal&hellip; Viva EU! I did see a car parked under a tree a few hundred metres away, other than that I was the only one around for miles and miles! </p>

      <p>Today was a bit of a mixed emotions day. I stayed in bed a little later than usual and then had a coffee with my warm showers host Rui. To my delight, he came over to my refuge with a coffee machine under his arm! He gave me some tips about the next day which I really appreciated and he kept saying “Good choice” which was also nice… Rui also looked at my bike and exhaled &ldquo;Too. Heavy!&rdquo;. I found it hilarious that he summed up my absolute torture so succinctly.</p>

<p>Rode out on some country trails for the first ten kilometres, and managed it in a swift forty four minutes! It was only nine am so feeling good about today! Then I entered the logging roads and man was there some climbing today… I feel like yesterday was worse but Strava said I climbed three hundred more metres today…. And also biked twenty kilometres more… so not sure how that works… </p>

Towards the end of the day I found a stream and tried out my life straw, it didn’t taste quite right, we shall wait for the repercussions tomorrow… I think it’ll be ok.</p>

<p>Only had one flat today and knew it immediately when I hit a pothole… didn’t even check, just stopped and got off the bike and went about it… that’s my last spare tube, while I put on the tube, I also patched the one I took off… I have never successfully patched a tube, hoping that if I need it tomorrow….

      <p>First 30km to Sagres was amazing!

I knew immediately too… spent another half hour changing another tire, was very stubborn to come on this time… atleast I was in an open field as opposed to the first time where I was in thorny rocky bush and bleeding down my shins…. We were about an hour and a half in and I had done a grand total of about 5kms… I’m at the part where I’m doing the tough thing that I’ve been talking about being a tough thing to do for the past month… and it’s tough…</p>

<p>Bike packed up in a box, gear meticulously curated over hours and hours of packing, unpacking, repacking and imagining the time i&rsquo;ll need a Life Straw, or a parachord or a glass bottle of perfume. Spoiler&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t need any of that stuff&hellip; The plan for day 1 was simple. Land in Faro at 10:30am, put my bike together and cycle to Albufiera campground about 50kms away for the night. Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

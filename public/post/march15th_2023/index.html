    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>All in all yesterday was a shit day… today in contrast, was great! Only did fifty odd kms but still managed to climb 900m… didn’t feel totally destroyed as it was a more gradual grade on better roads… I think I pushed my bike once today! Crossed the border in the middle of nowhere over a stream on a stone bridge about 2 feet high.. Rui, my host from yesterday said that this used to be an old illegal border crossing but now not so illegal&hellip; Viva EU! I did see a car parked under a tree a few hundred metres away, other than that I was the only one around for miles and miles! </p>
<p>This morning was tough to get out of bed, the room had blackout windows and I was very comfy…. I also ended up staying up till 11pm last night pouring over maps and places to camp. I don’t know why I did it and it’s true, the anticipation and overthinking up to the point of actual doing is much worse than doing the thing itself. Note to self: make a plan as much as you have control over the situation, and then let the rest figure itself out, and as much as you look at a map, the uphills won’t magically disappear…</p>
<p>I got another room today when I reached  Santa Barbara. I must be this establishments only guest this season by the looks of it… good it means it was cheap! I didn’t know how much until I was checking in and then it came to the payment and the manager wrote down 30 euro… For a bed, shower and kitchen… happy days! </p>
<p>Today felt more like a rest day. I still found something to panic over, and today it was food… went to the grocery and bought too much&hellip; now don’t know what to do with the eggs and tomato and yoghurt I bought lol! I will leave them behind and hopefully the manager will find use for them, or just find them (hopefully). I did manage to make a pasta in the microwave as well as a potato egg thing that wasn’t too great… was happy to not have to eat a ham and cheese sandwich for the 17th meal in a row….</p>
<p>Tomorrow is another climbing day and possibly a long day in kms too, I know it’s gonna be tough but looking forward to it! If possible I will try to get all the way to Galaroza where I have a homestay lined up… I don’t think I’m getting much fitter, but the weather has been amazing, the riding has been non dramatic, I haven’t had a flat tire in 2 days… I didn’t lose anything off my bike today&hellip; so I’d say things are on the up and up! Vamos!</p>

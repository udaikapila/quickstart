    <meta name="description" content="It’s 10:30pm and I’m too tired to write all that happened today… it felt like 5 days in one… so in point form a reminder of today:

frustrating leaky tube all day, stopped to pump five or six times before it became too much… v frustrating flat tire to change… knew it befor I started and it was as expected… bled everywhere
Ride with the wind was so grateful… so many climbs I wouldn’t have made it without the wind
Albergue, I’m the only one here, it’s a bit awkward to be the only one here but so it is
Riding by the ocean today… as imagined… love it
Little off-road today, was a good balance between road and dirt
Asked someone to take my picture, something I couldn’t do yesterday… growth…
Accidentally spent $100 downloading music… atleast I have music for the rest of the trip now…
Cold and windy, it is going to rain tomorrow
Big dinner, was nice… played with dog, was nice…

Notes from 2 years later: I wish I had written more about this places. The Albergue is a converted house (as most of them are), with the attic stacked with bunk beds. There is a couple that lives here, they had a lot of fun making fun of me. They also have a girl who stays with them and helps run the place. Her name is Flo&hellip; she is from France, and she is very nice, in a playful way, in a way that suggest that she is searching for a life irregular, maybe not irregular, maybe unconventional. She has a dog named Patch. Patch ran off from the house so we went to find him at the neighbour&rsquo;s. Flo and I and Patch went for a walk in the evening. The weather was terrible, windy and cold and I’ve never seen a dog poo so much in my life haha… Flo wanted to show me a hidden spot on the ridge that she liked to come to, to be more alone than she was already in this town. What are you hiding from Flo!">

<p><em>Notes from 2 years later: I wish I had written more about this places. The Albergue is a converted house (as most of them are), with the attic stacked with bunk beds.

Her name is Flo&hellip; she is from France, and she is very nice, in a playful way, in a way that suggest that she is searching for a life irregular, maybe not irregular, maybe unconventional. She has a dog named Patch. Patch ran off from the house so we went to find him at the neighbour&rsquo;s. Flo and I and Patch went for a walk in the evening. The weather was terrible, windy and cold and I’ve never seen a dog poo so much in my life haha… Flo wanted to show me a hidden spot on the ridge that she liked to come to, to be more alone than she was already in this town.

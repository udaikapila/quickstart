<p><em>Notes from 2 years later: Hikers are fucking badass&hellip; one of the hikers was doing surgery on his blisters at the end of the night&hellip; he said he had to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; them everyday, and then walk over twenty kilometres. These hikers are out here for months, travelling in a week, what I can do in a day on my bike. I always thought biking was a perfect balance of pace of travel, slow enough to take in everything you pass, fast enough to keep you moving forward. I think that I&rsquo;m still too scared to go even slower, and slower and the most frightened yet, to stand still.</em></p>
<p>A quick note on food… I have found my favourite Spanish food, and it is a sandwich at a specific supermarket, they have it warmed up and ready to go… I know this might be very uncultured of me… but it’s difficult to ask for something special or local when I barely speak the language and places are a bit intimidating to be in… especially with the local crowd eyeballing you the whole time… anyway, I am happy with my supermarket haul and I am not thinking much about the cultural experience im supposedly missing out on… I think jamon y queso on some tostada is culture enough…</p>
<p>No plan for tomorrows ride either… I have a calm now that I&rsquo;m on the side of the ocean. I will cycle till I feel tired and then look for a place to stay… Now that I&rsquo;m on the coast, there are lots of options, there is a campground about 60kms away that looks promising, but if I feel good when I get there, I might risk it and keep going… good night!</p>

Started out the day with a decent breakfast and a little extra sleep since the sun rises an hour later now… the day was mostly uneventful, apart from the actual event of riding in the hills and some great views… stopped many times to eat and drink and enjoy it…


Wanted to get to Galaroza today so took the highway for the last twenty kms, and it was fairly busy which wasn’t fun to deal with and the twenty six kms took me nearly two and a half hours because it was very uphill for most of it… but then I did get about three kms of downhill fun as well!



I’m staying at Guillermo’s half finished yurt tonight… another night indoors which is nice, I want to take a break tomorrow and maybe this is the place for it… or maybe I ride on to Santa Olalla de Cala… I’m also contemplating taking a detour to Seville to go check it out… not made my mind up and too tired to think about it… maybe tomorrow is indeed a rest day…

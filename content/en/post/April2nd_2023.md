Today was a confusing day.. I already knew my target for the day and it was going to be a short day, I was done by 2pm, even had time to make some cheese and Jamon wraps outside the Hostel before it opened… anyway, I can’t even remember the ride that well.. a few fun and painful climbs, but short an sweet… bike was making some funny noises on the last descent.. 

I’m getting close to being done with these hiker hostels… the experience is always hit and miss… and sometimes the conversations are just plain painful, and I’m done with the awkward silences and the over sharing… I just want to ride my bike…. But then when I’m alone for too long, that is not my soul purpose either… so a confusing day… I still don’t know what my soul desires

Dinner was good, I was conflicted to only put 20 euro in the donation box, I’m not sure why or if it’s an ego thing or what… but if I put 30 then I feel bad for overspending, if I put less, I feel bad for being cheap and “what will they think” when I know it’s completely anonymous and also nobody cares…

Anyway… do what you can do and then that’s it I guess… I’ll be happy to get on the bike tomorrow although I don’t want to stay at another hostel… it’s cold and miserable outside so I don’t want to camp either… don’t know what I want…

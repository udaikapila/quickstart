Today I get to share a room and a bed with a very animated old French man, so I will make this days update quick… morning was a nice ride with some climbing but nice… in a place filled with cyclists, like the hardcore kind, got a lot of waves and was ignored as well… rest of the day was tiring… and had to deal with a lot of traffic… and was very tired and hungry for the whole afternoon… I stopped a bunch and tried to refuel but didn’t get good… also front tire lost air on a descent and I have one of those tubes with sealant in it so I guess it fixed itself???? I don’t know and it’s bugging me…

Anyway got to the place, dinner was meh, had a nice 20 min stop on the waterfront before taking a wrong turn and having to push my bike up a very steep thing that was not a road… was tired to end the day… don’t know where I’m going tomorrow… will figure it out… tired.

Notes from 2 years later: 

I'm entering Basque country now... the oceanside roads are wonderful, and after that painstaking hike up to my stay tonight, I was rewarded with an awesome sunset over the mountains and ocean. There are rolling seaside ridges here with vineyards and other farm-type activity. It's not exactly the prairies but a little more interesting, with stone walls, horses, sheep and nice little farm roads. I like this part of "we are not Spain we are not France".

All in all yesterday was a shit day… today in contrast, was great! Only did fifty odd kms but still managed to climb 900m… didn’t feel totally destroyed as it was a more gradual grade on better roads… I think I pushed my bike once today! Crossed the border in the middle of nowhere over a stream on a stone bridge about 2 feet high.. Rui, my host from yesterday said that this used to be an old illegal border crossing but now not so illegal... Viva EU! I did see a car parked under a tree a few hundred metres away, other than that I was the only one around for miles and miles! 

This morning was tough to get out of bed, the room had blackout windows and I was very comfy…. I also ended up staying up till 11pm last night pouring over maps and places to camp. I don’t know why I did it and it’s true, the anticipation and overthinking up to the point of actual doing is much worse than doing the thing itself. Note to self: make a plan as much as you have control over the situation, and then let the rest figure itself out, and as much as you look at a map, the uphills won’t magically disappear…

I got another room today when I reached  Santa Barbara. I must be this establishments only guest this season by the looks of it… good it means it was cheap! I didn’t know how much until I was checking in and then it came to the payment and the manager wrote down 30 euro… For a bed, shower and kitchen… happy days! 

Today felt more like a rest day. I still found something to panic over, and today it was food… went to the grocery and bought too much... now don’t know what to do with the eggs and tomato and yoghurt I bought lol! I will leave them behind and hopefully the manager will find use for them, or just find them (hopefully). I did manage to make a pasta in the microwave as well as a potato egg thing that wasn’t too great… was happy to not have to eat a ham and cheese sandwich for the 17th meal in a row….

Tomorrow is another climbing day and possibly a long day in kms too, I know it’s gonna be tough but looking forward to it! If possible I will try to get all the way to Galaroza where I have a homestay lined up… I don’t think I’m getting much fitter, but the weather has been amazing, the riding has been non dramatic, I haven’t had a flat tire in 2 days… I didn’t lose anything off my bike today... so I’d say things are on the up and up! Vamos!
